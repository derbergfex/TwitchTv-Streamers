# TwitchTv-Streamers
This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code files for 'Use the Twitchtv JSON API', FreeCodeCamp's last intermediate front-end web development project.

The purpose behind building this application was to get some practice using APIs and JavaScript in general. I have used Twitchtv JSON API to build this app. The user can choose to view the online, offline or all the provided channels by simply clicking the 'online', 'offline' or 'all' buttons respectively.

To edit or add features to the web app on CodePen (https://codepen.io/derbergfex/pen/JyLRWd), simply press the 'Fork' button on the top-right side of the page.
